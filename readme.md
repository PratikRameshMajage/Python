# `Python`
## `Notes:`
- `Guido van Rossum` Inventer of `Python` - `Monty Python Flying Circus`.
- `James Gosling` - Inventer of `Java` - `Oak`
- `Dennis Ritchie` - Inventer of `C`.
- `Michael Widenius` - Inventer of `MySql`.
- `1991` & `Feb`,  Python came in 1989 so it's way befor java 1995.
- It is a `case sensitive language`
- Python can be used for : 
    - `Programming` (for Placements/online contests/DSA)
    - `Development` (using a backend framework called Django)
    - `Machine Learning` | `Data Science` | `Articial Intelligence` | `Software Devlopment` | `Web Devlopment` | `Gui`.
- Websites built using Python include `Google`, `Youtube`, `Instagram`, `Netfix`, `Uber`. `Dropbox`, `Nasa`, `Yahoo`, & `reddit` written in Python much more.
- `Python` (https://www.python.org/) It also Called the `General Purpose Language`
- Python 1.0 - 1994
- Python 2.0 - 2000 Depricate in 2020
- Python 3.0 - 2008 New and It has lot of Features.
- `PVM` - Python Vertual Machine witten in Assembly language Which use Machine Level Language and convert it into binary language. Do's (Byte Code Verification)
- `High Level Language` (HLL) -> Python, English
- `Low Level Language` (LLL) -> Machine Level Language, Assembly Language-> Registers, Ic's
- `Binery Language` -> Byte Code -> 0 & 1
- `Constructive Language` - Create a Server - That's why we can use Python in web
- `Scripting Language` -> Use in Hacking 
- `Interpriter Language` (Logical Exception) (Run Time Exception) (Bytecode Verification) -> Checks Byte Code Standards.
- `Compile Language` (Syntactical Error) (Compile Time Error)
<!-- - MySql -> YACC -> Yet Only Compile Compile -> C++ and MySql Two Compilers  -->
- `Robust in Nature` - Memory Management After Code Execution | `Clears Memory After Usage`
- `Scalable Language` - Compatible to Code with Every Language -> `MySql`, `JavaScript`
- `Integrated Devlopment Environment:`
    - Here No Need to Create New File
        - `Jupiter` -> Open Source
        - `Python CLI IDLE` (File will Not Be Save) REPL (Read Evaluate Print Loop) Prompt in Windows Shell in Mac
    - Here Need to Create New File
        - `VS Code` -> Microsoft and it is Open Source to Buid Yourself.
        - `Pycharm` -> JetBrains
- `Termination ( ; ):` Why Optional? -> In System Libraries(Assembly Language) already /n is available after the print("..."/n) so no need to ( ; ) Terminate Line. 
- `Concatination ( , ):` Join
- `Advanced Libraries` - Enumration ->: AI & Ml
    - Permutation and Combination
    - Probability
    - Statistics
    - `Numpy` - Data Manuplation -> Heavy Focus on Arrays
    - `Pandas` - Data Operations
    - `Matplotlib` - Visualisation -> Graphs, Ven Diagrams
- `Variable` -> The Name of Memory Location
- `print` -> Returns Each Charecter on Console Screen.
- `type` -> Returns Data Type of Data. 
- Companie Work on Python: `Infosis python 20%`, java 40%, deops 40%.
- Difference Between `Function` and `Method` -> Block of Code which Executes Targeted Code called Normal Function And Function Use in Class called Method. 
- `( : )` -> `Identation` -> Dependency Code (Indentation)
- Portable -> Works on Windows|Mac|Linux, Means platform Independent. 

- `Compiler:`
    - It Give's Error.
    - Compile Time Error.

    - At the Time of Interpritation.
    - It Will Show Partial Output or Exception.
    -
